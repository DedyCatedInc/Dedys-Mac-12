## Absolutely. Fastest **secure** path:

### 1) Prepare Windows 11 Pro host (the Stockbit machine)
- **Settings → System → Remote Desktop → Enable**
- Keep **Network Level Authentication (NLA)** ON
- Add only the specific user under “Remote Desktop users”
- Ensure that user has a **strong password** (no blank password allowed for RDP)

### 2) Lock down account security
- Use a dedicated local/user account for remote access (not daily admin)
- Make password long + unique
- Enable account lockout policy (e.g., lock after repeated failed logins)

### 3) Network setup (most important)
- **Best:** connect both machines through **VPN** (Tailscale / WireGuard / ZeroTier), then RDP over VPN IP
- **Avoid exposing port 3389 to public internet** directly
- If you must expose: restrict by firewall source IP allowlist + non-default external port + fail2ban-style protection

### 4) Windows Firewall rules
- Allow RDP only on:
  - Private profile (or VPN interface)
  - Trusted source IP ranges only
- Disable broad “Any source” inbound rule if present

### 5) System hardening (quick wins)
- Run Windows Update fully
- Enable Microsoft Defender + real-time protection
- Turn on BitLocker (if available) for device protection
- Disable unused local admin accounts

### 6) Client-side (your control machine)
- Use Microsoft Remote Desktop client
- Save host as VPN IP/hostname
- Don’t store credentials on shared/public machine
- Verify certificate/host identity before first connect

### 7) Session hygiene
- Set idle timeout + auto lock on host
- Sign out when done (not just disconnect), especially if shared
- Keep Stockbit credentials inside password manager, not plaintext notes

### 8) Quick connection test flow
1. Ping/resolve host over VPN  
2. `mstsc` / Remote Desktop connect  
3. Confirm NLA prompt appears  
4. Login with dedicated account  
5. Open Stockbit and validate normal operation

If you want, next I can give you:
- a **10-minute Tailscale + RDP recipe** (fastest practical secure setup), or  
- a **strict enterprise-style setup** (RDP Gateway + MFA + logging).
